    The goal of this project is to manage content from users on the Betterflye platform. 
    The features include profanity censoring amongst text, image filtering, and Admin tools. 
    This ensures that our client can be confident that the content on the website is clean and family-friendly. 
    Creating an environment that is welcoming to all users is paramount to the Betterflye team,
    and our content management system enables the team to do so.

    User is able to search for a song, an artist, an album, or get song recommendations based on user input. 
    For example, if the user searched “Johnny Cash,” after hitting the “Search For Music” button, a table 
    displays the returned data from the Spotify API. When selecting a song, the user can hit the “Play” button
    at the bottom and is then taken to Spotify’s website, where a 30 second sample of the selected song is played.
